    <P style="color: blueviolet;">TVK (Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam) is the political party founded by actor Thalapathy Vijay. The party was officially announced in February 2024 with the aim of bringing change in Tamil Nadu politics. Vijay said TVK will focus mainly on the welfare of people, education, employment, healthcare, and fighting against corruption.The name itself — Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam — means Victory Federation of Tamil Nadu, which shows the party’s vision to uplift the state and ensure victory for the common people. TVK has a large youth following because Vijay has always inspired youngsters through his movies and real-life social activities. The party also emphasizes clean politics, transparency, and giving importance to ordinary people rather than dynasty politics.

In short, TVK stands for change, honesty, and people’s welfare, and it carries the hopes of many fans and the younger generation who believe Vijay can bring a fresh political culture to Tamil Nadu.</P>
