            <p style="color:brown">Divya Sasha was born on 9 September 2005 to Vijay and Sangeetha. She is the youngest in the family and is studying in Chennai. Divya is very private, just like her mother, and rarely appears in public events. However, she got a lot of attention when she made a cameo appearance as Vijay’s daughter in the movie Theri (2016). Even though it was a very small role, fans were excited to see her on screen with her father. Divya is said to be good in academics and extracurricular activities, but unlike her brother Jason Sanjay, she has not shown any particular interest in cinema till now. Vijay and Sangeetha are very protective of her, and she is growing up away from media attention, enjoying a simple student life.</p>
