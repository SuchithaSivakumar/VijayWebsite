            <p>Vijay married Sangeetha Sornalingam in 1999. 
                She is a Sri Lankan Tamil who grew up in the UK and later settled in India after marriage.
                 Sangeetha is known for her simplicity and has always stayed away from the media spotlight, unlike many celebrity wives.
                  She is a pillar of support for Vijay, managing the family and personal life while allowing him to focus on his film career. 
                  Despite being married to one of the biggest stars in Tamil cinema, she maintains a very private and low-profile life, 
                  ensuring that their children grow up in a normal and secure environment. Over the years, she has earned respect from fans for her humility
                   and dedication to family.</p>

                <P style="color: brown;">Vijay met Sangeetha Sornalingam, a Sri Lankan Tamil settled in the UK, during the late 1990s. 
                    Sangeetha was a big fan of Vijay, and their friendship slowly turned into love. Despite coming from different countries 
                    and backgrounds, their bond grew stronger over time. In 1999, they got married in a private ceremony, 
                    keeping it away from the media.

Sangeetha has always been a strong support in Vijay’s life, managing the family and maintaining privacy. 
She rarely appears in public but is deeply involved in taking care of their children, Jason Sanjay and Divya Sasha, 
and keeping the family grounded. Their relationship is often admired by fans because it shows mutual respect, understanding,
 and simplicity, away from the glitz and glamour of cinema.</P>
